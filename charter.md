# Scope of the work

The goal of this Group is to facilitate Text and Data Mining in Europe and elsewhere, by specifying a simple and practical machine-readable solution, capable of expressing the reservation of TDM rights - following the rules set by the new European DSM Directive / Art.4 - and the availability of machine-readable licenses for TDM actors. 

The solution shall:

1. Specify how a rightholder can indicate that TDM rights are reserved on Web resources he controls.
1. Specify how a rightholder can indicate whether a licence relative to TDM rights is available, and how to get it.
1. Specify a machine-readable format for licenses relative to TDM rights. 

The solution will be expressed as a Community Group Note detailing a format and a protocol. It shall rely on open standards and shall be easy to implement, with no economic or technical barriers. 

In order to be effective, the solution shall be developed taking into account the requirements of both rightsholders and technological companies, thanks to the involvment of all relevant stakeholders in the CG. After validation by industry bodies, the solution will then be recommended by the relevant professional associations from the publishing sector.

# Timeframe

A key milestone to take into account is June 2021, by when European Member States shall implement into their national law the provisions of the EU Directive. Technical implementations will soon follow.

The project shall be conducted swiftly, so that its first outcomes are available by that date. In the absence of a common solution, TDM actors may have to rely on terms and conditions written on content producers’ websites; non-interoperable national and sectorial implementations of the EU Directive may also appear, and such uncertainty around technical solutions could lead rightsholders to adopt a preemptive “opt-out” approach. 

Therefore, the deliverables of the project should be ready by June 2021, refined during the year, and the Community Group may close by the end of 2021, by Chair Request.

# Transparent Communication

The group will conduct all of its work on its public mailing list, via Github and during a public regular teleconference followed by public minutes.
Working and final documents will be available on Github.

# Community Group Process

The group operates under the Community and Business Group Process. Terms of this charter that conflict with those of the Community and Business Group Process are void.

# Chair Selection

The initial Chairs are Giulia Marangoni (AIE) and Laurent Le Meur (EDRLab).

Participants in this group can replace their Chair(s) at any time using a majority vote during a CG call.

# Amendments to this Charter

- Chairs may propose amendments to the charter by asking for a call for principled objections to the new charter. If, after a period of two weeks, no principled objections have been presented by a current member of the group, the new charter is approved.
- If a principled objection is posted to the mailing list or expressed in a regular call, then the chairs may either drop the amendment or proceed with a public vote.
- A public vote for a new charter must be called by the chairs within two weeks of the principled objection.
- Such vote will be open for two weeks, with ballots cast via the groups public mailing list. Each member of the group may cast one ballot, “yea” or “nay”. A new charter must receive 2/3 of the votes cast “yea” in the approval vote to pass.
- The group will use the amendment process for any substantive changes to the goals, scope, deliverables, decision process or rules for amending the charter.
