# TDM: what does it mean in practice? 

It is difficult to give strict boundaries to the notion of Text and Data Mining. The EU Copyright Directive offers the following definition:

*(2) ‘text and data mining’ means any automated analytical technique aimed at analysing text and data in digital form in order to generate information which includes but is not limited to patterns, trends and correlations”*

Further details are provided in Recital 8:

*“New technologies enable the automated computational analysis of information in digital form, such as text, sounds, images or data, generally known as text and data mining. Text and data mining makes the processing of large amounts of information with a view to gaining new knowledge and discovering new trends possible.”*

In a white paper, the EPC introduces it as  	

*“The ability of new technology to extract meaningful information from vast amounts of data.”*

From such definitions, it is clear that the following tasks differ from TDM (but are still within the scope of copyright and neighboring rights): 

- extracting content for the creation of digital archives,
- copying content for information retrieval purposes,
- crawling and  indexing of content for search & discovery purpose,
- creating snippets related to a specific search.
